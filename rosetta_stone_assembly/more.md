[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1289881/using-gcc-to-produce-readable-assembly) says compile with `-g`, `-static` and `-fverbose-asm` flags and then use `objdump -drwC -S -Mintel` to do `objdump`. A comment further down tells that `-fverbose-asm` adds comments only to the `.o` file that is all removed at compile time to assembly (`gcc rosetta.c -c -static -fverbose-asm -S`). Use [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/) to simultaneously look at both code and it's assembly output. The script behind godbolt is open source (find links [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38552116/how-to-remove-noise-from-gcc-clang-assembly-output), or [here](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer)).
