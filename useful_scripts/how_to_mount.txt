fdisk -l to find your device, also there's a method using LSBLK but I forgot that
next, create a mount point. then mount using $ sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/point
check man mount, man lsblk, man blkid

remember to umount when done, $ sudo umount /dev/sda2. It says ubuntu does this
automatically, but since I'm using qtile, not a desktop environment, I'll not
rely on it. I don't want my drive corrupted.
