install powerline-shell from pip
there are two ways to work with powerline fonts, check the powerline fonts github and documentation

for so long the default method wasn't working for hyper. So, I had to figure out the other method.
check if any powerline fonts are present in "fc-list | grep -i powerline". If only PowelineSymbols.otf
then it's the method that doesn't use patched fonts. Which works with Guake, but not hyper.
