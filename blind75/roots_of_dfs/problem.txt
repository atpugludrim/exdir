# 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes
Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` represents a directed edge from node `from_i` to node `to_i`.  
Find _the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable_. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.  
Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
