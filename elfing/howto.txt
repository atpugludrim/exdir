1. readelf -h exefile
2. readelf -l exefile
3. readelf -x .rodata exefile
4. objdump -s -j .rodata exefile
5. objdump -S exefile
6. objdump -d exefile
7. g++ -S src.cpp / gcc -S src.c
   to emit ASM from LLVM
8. find out about yasm, nasm and as
   as -o hello.o hello.c
   ld -s -o hello hello.o
9. the ld code won't work when linking with
   libraries like stdc++, so figure out what
   g++ does by typing g++ -v -o tmp hello.o
   it'll show a linking line (using collect2)
   and that line will contain path of all the
   libraries and required commands. Use the command.
