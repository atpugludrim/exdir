1. Data format to graph  |
2. graph to mptree       |--> Boost?
3. mptree to canlab
4. threading


PyTorch extension lib can only read tensors, it cannot read pytorch_geometric.Data,
but that'll be okay as long as I give individual tensors.

Need to figure out how boost graph is created and how to convert the tensors to
that format.
